#    ANDROID_ABI=armeabi-v7a - specifies the target Application Binary
#      Interface (ABI). This option nearly matches to the APP_ABI variable
#      used by ndk-build tool from Android NDK.
#
#      Possible targets are:
#        "armeabi" - ARMv5TE based CPU with software floating point operations
#        "armeabi-v7a" - ARMv7 based devices with hardware FPU instructions
#            this ABI target is used by default
#        "armeabi-v7a with NEON" - same as armeabi-v7a, but
#            sets NEON as floating-point unit
#        "armeabi-v7a with VFPV3" - same as armeabi-v7a, but
#            sets VFPV3 as floating-point unit (has 32 registers instead of 16)
#        "armeabi-v6 with VFP" - tuned for ARMv6 processors having VFP
#        "x86" - IA-32 instruction set
#        "mips" - MIPS32 instruction set
